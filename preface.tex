Dear readers,

The document you are about to explore is a collection of notes taken during the Data Analysis course lectures. We would like to make an important disclaimer: we cannot guarantee the absolute correctness of the information contained herein. As students, we are aware of the limits of our knowledge and the possibility of errors in reporting complex concepts.

However, we hope that this collection can still be helpful to you in preparing for the exam, as it has been for us during the study and review process. We encourage you to consult other sources as well and to ask questions if anything is unclear.
